      <h3>The Scalping Phenomenon</h3>
      <p>
        Scalpers purchase large quantities of new card sets with the intent to resell them at inflated prices. This 
        practice has severely limited the availability of Prismatic Evolutions for genuine enthusiasts. For instance, 
        the recommended retail price for Prismatic Evolutions Elite Trainer Boxes is $49.99 USD, yet listings on 
        secondary markets like eBay range from $90 to nearly $200 USD.
      </p>

      <h3>Impact on Players and Collectors</h3>
      <p>
        The scarcity induced by scalpers has left many players unable to access new cards essential for competitive 
        play. Collectors, too, face challenges in obtaining desired cards without paying exorbitant prices. This 
        situation has led to a sense of disenchantment among long-time fans who feel alienated from a hobby they once 
        enjoyed.
      </p>

      <h3>Resale Values of Prismatic Evolutions Cards</h3>
      <p>
        The inflated resale market has seen significant price hikes for individual cards from the Prismatic Evolutions 
        set. Notably, the Umbreon ex Special Illustration Rare card has been valued at approximately $1,700, while the 
        Sylveon ex Special Illustration Rare is around $700. These elevated prices reflect the high demand and limited 
        supply orchestrated by scalpers.
      </p>

      <h3>Voices from the Community</h3>
      <p>
        Prominent Pokémon influencers have expressed concerns over the current state of the market. PokeRev, a 
        well-known YouTuber with nearly 3 million subscribers, has openly discussed the guilt he feels showcasing new 
        sets that his audience struggles to obtain. Such sentiments highlight the growing divide between content 
        creators and their communities due to accessibility issues.
      </p>

      <h3>Challenges for Small Card Shop Owners</h3>
      <p>
        Local card shops are also grappling with the repercussions of scalping. Many are forced to sell products at 
        higher prices to match the secondary market, straining relationships with loyal customers. Additionally, the 
        inability to sell single packs, as special sets like Prismatic Evolutions are only available in bundled 
        products, further complicates sales strategies and affects market dynamics.
      </p>

      <h3>Speculation on Nintendo's Role</h3>
      <p>
        Some community members question whether The Pokémon Company is intentionally limiting supply to inflate card 
        values. However, official statements indicate efforts to combat scalping and increase production to meet 
        demand, suggesting that shortages are not a deliberate strategy.
      </p>

      <h3>Chaotic Scenes at Retailers</h3>
      <p>
        The high demand has led to chaotic scenes at retail stores, with reports of long lines and individuals 
        purchasing excessive quantities of products. In some instances, this has resulted in physical altercations 
        among customers vying for limited stock. To mitigate such issues, certain retailers have implemented purchase 
        limits to ensure broader access.
      </p>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        The excitement surrounding Prismatic Evolutions has been marred by scalping activities, affecting players, 
        collectors, and small business owners. While The Pokémon Company has acknowledged these challenges and is 
        taking steps to address them, the community continues to advocate for fairer distribution practices to 
        preserve the integrity and enjoyment of the Pokémon TCG.
