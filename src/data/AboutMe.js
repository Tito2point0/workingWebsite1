const aboutMe = `
Hi there! My name is Jason Vasquez, and I’m an aspiring web developer from New York City. As a recent graduate of BloomTech's Full Stack Web Development Program, I’ve gained the skills needed to create dynamic and efficient web applications. My journey into tech was shaped by my earlier work in construction at Archstone Builders, where I developed strong problem-solving, teamwork, and leadership skills as a Head Laborer and Assistant Superintendent.

Currently, I’m focused on building personal projects using tools like React, Node.js, and SQLite3, and I’m passionate about creating applications that make a meaningful impact. When I’m not coding, I’m diving into the world of Pokémon, a lifelong love that continues to inspire my creativity and perseverance. I’m excited to keep learning, growing, and contributing to projects that blend innovation and passion.
