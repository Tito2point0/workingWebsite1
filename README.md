# Pokémon Card Search & Daily Blog Website

## Project Overview

This project is a **React-based web application** that serves as a platform to **search for Pokémon cards** and **read daily blogs**. The website allows users to search for cards from the Pokémon Trading Card Game (TCG) and provides options for browsing content via a responsive and user-friendly interface. Additionally, the website is styled with **dark mode** toggle functionality for enhanced user experience. It is currently hosted on **IONOS** with a custom domain.

- **[x] Dark Mode Toggle**: A global dark mode feature using `useState` and `useEffect` hooks that allows users to toggle between dark and light themes. The user's preference is saved in `localStorage`.

Future Improvements
Improve Performance: Optimize images and use lazy loading to enhance site performance.
Accessibility: Ensure that the website meets WCAG accessibility standards for users with disabilities.
Automated Testing: Write Jest unit tests and Cypress end-to-end tests to ensure smooth functionality over time.
Known Issues

[ ] Banner issues on mobile: The banner may not scale correctly on smaller devices. Future updates will address this with media queries and better responsiveness.

[ ] Metadata Caching Issues: Sometimes, changes to the metadata (such as the favicon or mobile icon) take time to propagate due to aggressive browser caching.

Explanation of Markdown Features:
Bold Text: Use ** on both sides of the text. Example: **bold text** renders bold text.
Headers: Use # to create headers. One # creates the largest header, and ###### creates the smallest.
Task List: Use - [ ] for unchecked tasks, and - [x] for checked tasks.
With these steps, your README should look formatted and well-structured on GitHub.
